#+TITLE: Solutions to the SICP problems

* Foreword
The following solutions to the [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html][SICP]] problems were tested using [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] and the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html][#lang sicp]] directive.
Since at the moment of writing these lines I consider myself a novice schemer, I cannot ensure
that my solutions are optimal. If you want to compare with other people's work, feel free to
visit the Scheme [[http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions][wiki]], and the references therein.
