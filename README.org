* SICP solutions

These are my solutions to the problems included in Abelson and Sussmand's
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ([[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html][SICP]]).
The obvious choice for this endeavor would have been =org-mode=, however [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html][scribble]]
(and the whole [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] ecosystem, really) seems to be a very interesting alternative.
Using the later, I am in a way also using Scheme for generating the [[https://panadestein.github.io/solved_sicp/][solution's website]], which
looks really nice by default.
