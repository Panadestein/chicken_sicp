* SICP solutions

These are my solutions to the problems included in Abelson and Sussmand's Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs ([[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html][SICP]]). The obvious choice for this endeavor would be =org-mode=, however [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html][scribble]] seems to be a very
interesting alternative.

* TODO

So far I am building the site locally using:

#+begin_src bash
  scribble --htmls ++xref-in setup/xref load-collections-xref\
   --redirect-main "https://docs.racket-lang.org/" --dest build/ sicp.scrbl
#+end_src

This will eventually go in a continuous integration pipeline.
