This repo contains my solutions to problems in "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" ([[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/][SICP]]).
The goal is to offer a comprehensive and clean set of answers to this seminal book in computer science.

* Technical Choices 

The solutions are organized and presented in a visually appealing manner,
and can be viewed either directly in the source code or on the automatically generated [[https://panadestein.github.io/solved-sicp/][website]]. 
Initially, I considered using =org-mode= with =org-babel= for this project,
but I ultimately chose to use  [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html][scribble]] and the [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] ecosystem.
This decision was driven by my desire to also use Scheme for generating the solution's website.

* Contributions welcome

While the pursuit of knowledge is oftentimes a solitary endeavor, the sharing of insights elevates
it to the sublime. Feel free to contribute, critique, or engage in intellectual discourse
through issues and pull requests.
