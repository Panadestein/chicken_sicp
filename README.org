This repository features my solutions to the problems included in Abelson and Sussman's
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" ([[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/][SICP]]).

The solutions are organized and presented in a visually appealing manner,
and can be viewed either directly in the source code or on the automatically generated [[https://panadestein.github.io/solved_sicp/][website]]. 
Initially, I considered using =org-mode= with =org-babel= for this project,
but I ultimately chose to use  [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html][scribble]] and the [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] ecosystem.
This decision was driven by my desire to also use Scheme for generating the solution's website.
