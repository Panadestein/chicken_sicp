These are my solutions to the problems included in Abelson and Sussmand's
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ([[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/][SICP]]).

The solutions are organized in a nice website. The obvious choice for this endeavor
would have been =org-mode= with [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]], however, [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html][scribble]]
(and the whole [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] ecosystem) seemed to be a very interesting alternative. I decided for the later,
because in a way, I am also using Scheme for generating the [[https://panadestein.github.io/solved_sicp/][solution's website]].
